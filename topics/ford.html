                    <p class="content-lead">Ford isn't just a car company—it's a case study in how systems reshape societies, how innovation creates new constraints, and how century-old institutions face extinction-level adaptation challenges.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Origins: The Tinkerer and His Third Attempt (1863-1903)</h3>
                    <p>Henry Ford was born in 1863 on a Michigan farm, but he was never a farmer. He was a machinist, a tinkerer, obsessed with machines. After two failed automobile ventures—the Detroit Automobile Company in 1899 and the Henry Ford Company in 1901—he tried again in 1903.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ford Motor Company was incorporated on June 16, 1903, with $28,000 in capital from twelve investors. What made this attempt different wasn't the car—it was the obsession with making cars affordable. Ford wasn't interested in luxury vehicles for the wealthy. He wanted to build machines that ordinary people could own.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Model T and the System That Changed Everything (1908-1927)</h3>
                    <p>The Model T launched in 1908. It was simple, durable, and designed for mass production. But the real revolution came in 1913 at Highland Park: the moving assembly line. By breaking production into 84 discrete steps and bringing the work to the worker, Ford cut Model T assembly time from over 12 hours to 93 minutes.</p>
                    
                    <p>The $5 workday announcement in January 1914 shocked the industrial world—more than double the prevailing wage. The motivations were layered: turnover at the Highland Park plant hit 370% annually because the work was so monotonous. Higher wages reduced turnover and attracted better workers. But there was another logic: workers who earned enough to buy the products they made created a virtuous cycle of production and consumption.</p>
                    
                    <p>This wasn't pure altruism. Ford's Sociological Department investigated workers' home lives, enforcing sobriety and "proper" living standards. The $5 wage came with strings. But the core insight—that mass production required mass consumption—became the foundation of twentieth-century capitalism. This system would later be called Fordism.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Contradictions of Henry Ford</h3>
                    <p>Henry Ford was a visionary industrialist and a deeply flawed human being. In 1915, he chartered a "Peace Ship" to Europe, believing he could negotiate an end to World War I. The mission failed, but it revealed Ford's genuine pacifist convictions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Those convictions didn't extend to everyone. From 1920 to 1927, Ford's newspaper, the Dearborn Independent, published virulently antisemitic articles, including the fraudulent "Protocols of the Elders of Zion." Ford later apologized, but the damage was permanent. Adolf Hitler kept a portrait of Ford in his office and cited him as an inspiration in Mein Kampf.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ford's resistance to unions was equally fierce. The Battle of the Overpass in 1937—when Ford's security forces beat United Auto Workers organizers outside the Rouge plant—became a defining image of labor conflict. Ford was the last of the Big Three automakers to recognize the UAW, finally signing a contract in 1941.</p>
                    
                    <p>How do you reconcile the man who doubled workers' wages with the man who had union organizers beaten? You don't. You hold both truths simultaneously.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Corporate Evolution: After Henry (1945-2000)</h3>
                    <p>Henry Ford II took control after World War II, inheriting a company in chaos. He brought in the "Whiz Kids"—ten Air Force veterans including Robert McNamara—who introduced modern management systems and saved the company from potential collapse.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 1956 IPO was the largest common stock offering in American history to that point. But the Ford family retained control through a dual-class stock structure that persists today: the family holds approximately 40% of voting power with only about 2% of equity.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Mustang launch in 1964 created an entirely new market category—the "pony car"—and sold 418,812 units in its first year. But Ford's history also includes the Pinto, whose fuel tank design flaw led to fatal fires. Internal memos revealed Ford had calculated that paying out lawsuits would cost less than a recall. The cost-benefit analysis became a case study in corporate ethics.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Ford Explorer/Firestone tire crisis in the 1990s killed over 270 people and ended a century-long supplier relationship. Again, questions emerged about what the company knew and when.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Present Crisis: Electric Crossroads</h3>
                    <p>Today, Ford faces challenges that dwarf anything in its history. The F-Series has been America's best-selling truck for over 40 years—it is Ford's profit engine. But the industry is shifting toward electrification, and Ford's EV investments have produced massive losses.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Ford+ restructuring in 2022 split the company into Ford Blue (traditional vehicles) and Ford Model e (electric vehicles and software). The logic was to let each unit operate with different cultures and metrics. Ford Model e has posted billions in losses while the company recalibrates its electric strategy.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 2023 UAW strike resulted in record wage increases and the return of cost-of-living adjustments. CEO Jim Farley called it a "watershed moment" that would force Ford to reconsider where it builds vehicles. Labor costs matter more when margins are thin.</p>
                    
                    <p>Competition is intensifying from every direction: Tesla's brand and technology lead, legacy rivals like GM also transitioning, and Chinese manufacturers producing capable EVs at price points American companies struggle to match.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Unresolved Questions</h3>
                    <p>Ford embodies fundamental tensions that have no clean resolution. What does a company become when the technology that defined it for 120 years is being phased out? Can family control that provided long-term stability also provide the agility needed for rapid transformation? What is owed to the workers and communities that built Fordism—and what happens when that system is no longer viable?</p>
                    
                    <p>The company that invented mass production now faces the question of whether mass production logic applies to software-defined electric vehicles. The answer isn't clear. The outcome isn't written.</p>
