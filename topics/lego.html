                    <h2 class="section-title">A System Built to Make Play Last</h2>
                    
                    <p class="content-lead">LEGO isn't just a toy company—it's a precision manufacturing system that turns constraints into creativity. The same brick connects across 70 years because the tolerances never slip.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Origins: The Carpenter and the Name (1932-1949)</h3>
                    <p>In 1932, Ole Kirk Christiansen was a carpenter in Billund, Denmark, struggling through the Great Depression. When construction work dried up, he started making wooden toys—yo-yos, pull toys, trucks. In 1934, he named his company LEGO, from the Danish "leg godt" meaning "play well." He didn't know until later that it also means "I put together" in Latin.</p>
                    
                    <p>The transition to plastic came in 1947 when Christiansen became one of the first in Denmark to buy a plastic injection molding machine. By 1949, LEGO produced its first plastic bricks—"Automatic Binding Bricks"—based on a British design by Kiddicraft. They were crude by modern standards, but the direction was set.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The System of Play (1955-1978)</h3>
                    <p>The breakthrough came in 1955 when Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, Ole's son, articulated the "System of Play"—the idea that all LEGO elements should work together as part of a unified system. In 1958, the modern brick design was patented: the tubes underneath that create the clutch power, the precise dimensions that enable infinite combinations.</p>
                    
                    <p>This wasn't just product design—it was a commitment. A brick made in 1958 would connect with one made decades later. That promise required manufacturing tolerances of 2 microns (0.002mm). The precision is so exact that LEGO claims only 18 out of every million elements fail quality control.</p>
                    
                    <p>The system expanded: minifigures arrived in 1978, creating characters to inhabit the brick worlds. Themes emerged—Town, Space, Castle. Each addition had to work with everything that came before.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Near-Death and Rebirth (1998-2004)</h3>
                    <p>By the late 1990s, LEGO was in crisis. The company had expanded into theme parks (LEGOLAND), clothing, video games, and media while the core brick business stagnated. Competition from video games intensified. Licensed themes were introduced—Star Wars in 1999—but weren't enough to offset declining sales.</p>
                    
                    <p>By 2003, LEGO faced $800 million in debt and was losing $1 million per day. The company was close to bankruptcy. In 2004, Jørgen Vig Knudstorp became CEO—the first non-family member to lead the company. His prescription: return to the brick.</p>
                    
                    <p>Knudstorp sold LEGOLAND, cut product lines, and refocused on what LEGO did better than anyone: the system. The turnaround was dramatic. By 2015, LEGO had become the world's largest toy company by revenue, surpassing Mattel.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Licensing Transformation</h3>
                    <p>The Star Wars partnership that began in 1999 transformed LEGO's business model. Licensed themes—Harry Potter, Marvel, DC, Disney—now represent a significant portion of revenue. The LEGO Movie (2014) proved the brand could anchor entertainment properties, not just merchandise them.</p>
                    
                    <p>But licensing raises questions. Does building a pre-designed Millennium Falcon exercise the same creative muscles as building from a bucket of bricks? LEGO tries to balance both: licensed sets for narrative engagement, Classic and Creator lines for open-ended building. The tension between structured play and free creativity isn't resolved—it's managed.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Constraints That Enable Freedom</h3>
                    <p>LEGO's paradox is that creativity requires constraint. The brick's dimensions are fixed. The clutch power is specified. The color palette is controlled. These limitations are what make infinite combinations possible—because everything works with everything else.</p>
                    
                    <p>The same logic applies to manufacturing. LEGO produces approximately 100 billion pieces per year across 60+ colors and thousands of element types. Maintaining backward compatibility at that scale requires systems, not inspiration. The ABS plastic formula is precisely controlled. Molds are replaced before tolerances drift.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Sustainability Question</h3>
                    <p>LEGO faces a fundamental tension: the durability that makes bricks valuable—they last forever—is the same property that makes them environmentally problematic. Plastic doesn't biodegrade. LEGO has committed to sustainable materials by 2030, but finding alternatives that maintain the precision tolerances across decades of temperature changes and stress remains an unsolved engineering problem.</p>
                    
                    <p>The company has experimented with plant-based plastics for botanical elements (leaves, trees) but the core brick remains ABS. Some argue that LEGO's durability is itself sustainable—bricks passed between generations don't enter the waste stream. Others note that 100 billion new pieces per year is 100 billion new pieces per year.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Unresolved Questions</h3>
                    <p>Can creativity remain central as systems scale? How much freedom can structured play actually support? What happens when the durability that defines a product becomes the obstacle to its evolution? These aren't questions LEGO has answered—they're tensions the company navigates continuously.</p>
                    
                    <p>LEGO endures because it built a system, not just a product. The brick is simple. The system is not.</p>
