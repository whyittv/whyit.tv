                    <h2 class="section-title">A System Under Constraint</h2>
                    
                    <p class="content-lead">Harley-Davidson isn't just a motorcycle company—it's a case study in how brands become cultural symbols, how symbols become constraints, and how constraints threaten survival.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Phase 1: Industrial Genesis (1903-1945)</h3>
                    <p>In 1903, four young men in Milwaukee built a motorcycle in a small wooden shed: William S. Harley and the three Davidson brothers—Arthur, Walter, and William. In an age of boilers, horses, and steel, they offered affordable mechanical power. By 1920, production had soared from one bike to over 29,000 annually.</p>
                    
                    <p>The V-twin engine, introduced in 1909, became the company's defining technical identity. Its distinctive rumble and torque created a visceral experience that competitors couldn't easily replicate. This wasn't just engineering—it was the foundation of a brand moat.</p>
                    
                    <p>World War I and II transformed Harley from regional manufacturer to industrial powerhouse. The company supplied approximately 20,000 motorcycles to Allied forces in WWI and over 90,000 "Liberator" bikes in WWII. Military contracts brought scale, discipline, and—crucially—a generation of young men trained on Harleys.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Phase 2: Rebels and Symbols (1946-1985)</h3>
                    <p>Post-war prosperity birthed the "biker" identity. Veterans returned home and transformed surplus military bikes into symbols of rebellion and freedom. The 1953 film "The Wild One" starring Marlon Brando, and later "Easy Rider" (1969), cemented motorcycles—specifically Harleys—as countercultural icons.</p>
                    
                    <p>But the corporate reality diverged from the freedom myth. AMF (American Machine and Foundry) acquired Harley-Davidson in 1969 and prioritized volume over quality. The results were catastrophic: over 50% of bikes failed inspection off the assembly line. Meanwhile, Japanese manufacturers—Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki—entered the American market with high-quality, affordable alternatives.</p>
                    
                    <p>Harley's market share collapsed from 80% to 20% by the late 1970s. The brand that symbolized American freedom was being destroyed by American corporate mismanagement.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Phase 3: System or Survival (1986-Present)</h3>
                    <p>In 1981, thirteen Harley executives executed a leveraged buyout to regain control from AMF. They faced near-bankruptcy but implemented a turnaround strategy that became a business school case study: lobbying for protective tariffs on Japanese imports to buy time, adopting lean manufacturing principles (JIT inventory, statistical process control, employee involvement), and—critically—doubling down on heritage rather than chasing competitors.</p>
                    
                    <p>By 1996, Harley had reclaimed market leadership in the US super-heavyweight segment. The company didn't try to out-engineer Honda; it sold an experience, a community, a lifestyle. Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.) became the largest factory-sponsored motorcycle club in the world.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Current Crisis</h3>
                    <p>Today, Harley-Davidson faces existential challenges that heritage alone cannot solve. The "demographic cliff" is real: the median US motorcycle owner age climbed from 32 in 1980 to 50 in 2019. The core customer base is aging out, and younger riders aren't replacing them at the same rate.</p>
                    
                    <p>The V-twin engine—once a moat—has become a trap. Brand identity is bound to a technology that struggles with modern emission and noise regulations. The LiveWire electric motorcycle division, spun off to attract new riders, saw sales drop 72% year-over-year in early 2025.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sales declined 27% in the first half of 2025. Tariff pressures, economic uncertainty, and the fundamental question of whether a 120-year-old brand can reinvent itself without losing what made it matter in the first place—these are not problems that can be solved by better marketing.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Unresolved Questions</h3>
                    <p>Harley-Davidson embodies a tension at the heart of American identity: the myth of individual freedom sustained by corporate systems, the rebellion commodified into lifestyle products, the heritage that both protects and constrains. Whether the brand survives the next decade depends on whether it can evolve without erasing what made it iconic—a challenge with no clear precedent.</p>
